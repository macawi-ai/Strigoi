# MCP Security Analysis - Critical Findings
# Based on Complete Topology Extraction

critical_security_gaps:
  
  1_no_authentication:
    finding: "Protocol has ZERO authentication mechanisms"
    evidence:
      - "No auth-related definitions in 83 data types"
      - "No token/credential handling"
      - "Trust model assumes secure transport"
    risk: CRITICAL
    exploit_scenario: "Anyone can connect and call tools"
    
  2_experimental_capabilities:
    finding: "Servers can define arbitrary experimental features"
    evidence:
      location: ServerCapabilities.experimental
      constraint: "additionalProperties: true"
    risk: HIGH
    exploit_scenario: "Malicious server advertises 'experimental.executeShellCommand'"
    
  3_unconstrained_tool_execution:
    finding: "tools/call has no built-in restrictions"
    evidence:
      - "inputSchema is server-defined"
      - "No permission model"
      - "No rate limiting"
    risk: CRITICAL
    exploit_scenario: "Call tool 'deleteDatabase' with {confirm: true}"
    
  4_resource_access_control:
    finding: "resources/read can access any URI"
    evidence:
      - "URI format not restricted"
      - "No path traversal prevention"
      - "file://, http://, any scheme allowed"
    risk: HIGH
    exploit_scenario: "Read file:///etc/passwd or internal URLs"
    
  5_message_injection:
    finding: "sampling/createMessage generates LLM content"
    evidence:
      - "Server can request arbitrary content generation"
      - "No content filtering specified"
      - "maxTokens but no content restrictions"
    risk: HIGH
    exploit_scenario: "Generate phishing emails or malicious code"
    
  6_no_audit_trail:
    finding: "No required logging/auditing"
    evidence:
      - "Logging is optional capability"
      - "No mandatory security events"
      - "No tamper-proof logs"
    risk: MEDIUM
    impact: "Cannot detect abuse after the fact"
    
attack_surface_matrix:
  
  entry_points:
    - transport_layer: "TCP/stdio connection"
    - initialization: "First contact, declare capabilities"
    - tool_discovery: "List available tools"
    - tool_execution: "Call tools with params"
    - resource_access: "Read arbitrary resources"
    - prompt_injection: "Get server prompts"
    - message_generation: "Request LLM output"
    
  privilege_escalation:
    - "Start with list tools"
    - "Find administrative tools"
    - "Call with crafted parameters"
    - "No authorization checks"
    
  data_exfiltration:
    - "List all resources"
    - "Read sensitive URIs"
    - "Subscribe to updates"
    - "No access logging"
    
  denial_of_service:
    - "No rate limiting"
    - "Large pagination requests"
    - "Recursive tool calls"
    - "Resource exhaustion"
    
classification_for_strigoi:
  risk_score: 5  # Maximum
  priority: week_1_critical
  reasoning:
    - "Zero authentication = immediate exploit"
    - "Widespread adoption (Anthropic + OpenAI)"
    - "Experimental features = unlimited attack surface"
    - "Trust model assumes secure environment (bad assumption)"
    
  test_categories:
    authentication_bypass:
      tests_needed: 0  # Nothing to bypass!
      
    authorization_flaws:
      - "Call admin tools without permission"
      - "Access restricted resources"
      - "Modify server state"
      
    injection_attacks:
      - "Tool parameter injection"
      - "Prompt template manipulation"
      - "Resource URI injection"
      
    information_disclosure:
      - "List all tools/resources"
      - "Read sensitive data"
      - "Probe experimental capabilities"
