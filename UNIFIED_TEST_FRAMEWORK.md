## RISK PRIORITIZATION MATRIX

### Enhanced Formula
```
Priority Score = Severity × Frequency × (1/Recoverability) × Variety_Leak_Magnitude × Topology_Risk
```

### Scoring Dimensions
```yaml
severity:
  CRITICAL: 10 (data loss, security breach)
  HIGH: 7 (feature broken)
  MEDIUM: 4 (partial function)
  LOW: 1 (cosmetic)
  
frequency:
  ALWAYS: 10 (100% reproduction)
  OFTEN: 7 (>50% occurrence)
  SOMETIMES: 4 (10-50%)
  RARE: 1 (<10%)
  
recoverability:
  IMPOSSIBLE: 10 (requires rebuild)
  HARD: 7 (manual intervention)
  MODERATE: 4 (auto-recovery slow)
  EASY: 1 (instant recovery)
  
variety_leak_magnitude:
  MASSIVE: 10 (complete topology breach)
  LARGE: 7 (multiple loops affected)
  MODERATE: 4 (single loop affected)
  SMALL: 1 (contained leak)
  
topology_risk:
  SYSTEMIC: 10 (affects entire VSM level)
  REGIONAL: 7 (affects subsystem)
  LOCAL: 4 (affects component)
  ISOLATED: 1 (single point)
```
