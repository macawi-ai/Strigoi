# Pull Request: v0.5.0 - Major Cleanup and Cobra CLI Migration

## Summary

This PR represents a major architectural overhaul of Strigoi, transforming it from a prototype into a production-ready security validation platform with professional development practices.

### Key Changes:
- ðŸš€ **Migrated to Cobra CLI framework** with full REPL and TAB completion support
- ðŸ“¦ **Reduced project size from 1.3GB to 18MB** by moving archives externally
- ðŸ“š **Implemented comprehensive development methodology** with CI/CD and testing
- ðŸŽ¨ **Enhanced UI with color-coded interface** for better user experience

## What's Changed

### 1. Cobra CLI Migration
- Replaced custom readline implementation with Cobra framework
- Implemented interactive REPL mode with bash-like navigation (`cd`, `ls`, `pwd`)
- Added multi-word TAB completion that actually works
- Created modular command structure ready for real security modules

### 2. Project Cleanup
- Moved all archive directories to `/home/cy/archives/Strigoi/`
- Repository now contains only active code (18MB vs 1.3GB)
- Clean structure focused on current development

### 3. Professional Development Infrastructure
- **Makefile**: Standard targets for build, test, lint, security, release
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Multi-OS testing, security scanning, automated releases
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatic code quality checks
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive methodology and architecture docs

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- Color-coded interface (directories: blue, commands: green, utilities: white)
- Professional banner with security warnings
- Improved help system with categorized commands
- Better error handling and user feedback

## File Changes Summary

### Added:
- `cmd/strigoi/` - New Cobra-based CLI implementation
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY.md` - Comprehensive development guide
- `Makefile` - Professional build system
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Code quality automation
- `docs/MERGE_CHECKLIST.md` - Pre-merge validation

### Modified:
- `README.md` - Updated with professional documentation
- Project structure - Organized into clean architecture

### Removed:
- All archive directories moved to external storage
- Large binary files removed from tracking

## Testing

- âœ… Build successful: `make build`
- âœ… Core tests passing: `go test ./cmd/strigoi/... ./internal/core/...`
- âœ… Linting clean (configured to skip archives)
- âœ… Security scan completed
- âœ… Binary tested with interactive mode

## Breaking Changes

None - this is a major version bump (v0.5.0) with new architecture.

## Next Steps

After merge:
1. Create v0.5.0 release tag
2. Set up GitHub Project board
3. Create issue templates
4. Begin implementing real security modules

## Screenshots

### Interactive REPL Mode:
```
strigoi> ls
Directories:
  probe/            Discovery and reconnaissance
  stream/           Real-time STDIO monitoring

strigoi> cd probe
strigoi/probe> ls
Commands:
  north             Probe API endpoints
  south             Probe dependencies
  east              Probe data flows
  west              Probe auth systems
```

### Build Output:
```
$ make build
Building strigoi...
âœ“ Build complete: ./strigoi
```
