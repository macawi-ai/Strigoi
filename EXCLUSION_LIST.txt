## VSM FILES NEEDING REVIEW
# These contain valuable security patterns but need de-identification:
# - Remove all Prismatic references
# - Remove specific integration IDs
# - Generalize as "Security Topology Framework"
internal/vsm/*.go  # Review each file individually

## FILES REQUIRING SANITIZATION BEFORE INCLUSION

6. Generic email addresses only (opensource@macawi.ai)
