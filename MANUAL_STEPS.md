# Manual Steps to Complete the v0.5.0 Release

Due to the large file history in git (3.6GB total), we need to handle this manually. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Force Push (Simplest)

Since this is your repository, you can force push after cleaning the history:

```bash
# Clean the git history of large files
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch archive/v0.4.0-root-files/docs/ACTIVE_MEMORY_SNAPSHOT_*.md \
   archive/snapshots/*.tar.gz \
   bin/* \
   archive/*/binaries/* \
   *.duckdb' \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Force push the cleaned branch
git push origin v0.5.0-cleanup --force
```

## Option 2: Create Fresh Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Copy only the essential files (excluding archives)
3. Push as initial commit

## Option 3: Use Git LFS

1. Install Git LFS
2. Track large files with LFS
3. Push normally

## Option 4: Manual Archive Upload

1. Remove archive directories from git
2. Create a GitHub Release
3. Upload archives as release assets

## What's Ready

All the development work is complete:
- ✅ Cobra CLI migration with REPL
- ✅ Professional development methodology  
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline and build system
- ✅ Clean architecture and documentation
- ✅ All tests passing

## Quick Manual Process

1. On GitHub.com:
   - Create new branch from main
   - Upload the key directories manually:
     - cmd/strigoi/
     - internal/
     - docs/
     - Makefile, go.mod, go.sum
     - .github/
     - README.md

2. Create PR with the description from PR_DESCRIPTION.md

3. Merge and tag v0.5.0

The large archives can be stored separately or cleaned from history.
