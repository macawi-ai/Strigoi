## Signing and Verification

### GPG Signing for Test Integrity
```bash
# Sign critical test results
gpg --sign evidence/2025-07-21-001/test-results.json

# Sign lab notebook entries
git commit -S -m "test(mcp): Critical vulnerability discovered"

# Verify test suite integrity
strigoi verify-suite --signature mcp-v1.0.sig
```

### Blockchain Timestamping (Optional)
```typescript
// For critical discoveries, timestamp on blockchain
const discovery = {
  protocol: "MCP",
  vulnerability: "Unicode Bypass",
  hash: sha256(evidenceFiles),
  timestamp: Date.now()
};

await blockchain.timestamp(discovery);
```

## Benefits of Git Laboratory

1. **Immutable History**: Can't alter test records after the fact
2. **Peer Review**: PRs ensure test quality
3. **Traceability**: Every finding traced to specific commit
4. **Reproducibility**: Clone and re-run any test
5. **Collaboration**: Distributed testing with merge capabilities
6. **Automation**: CI/CD for test execution and reporting
