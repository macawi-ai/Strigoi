# Agentic Protocols - Elevator Pitch

## The Problem & Solution

Every company is deploying AI agents that have access to critical systems and data. Attackers are now using AI to compromise these agents at superhuman speed - one compromised agent can cascade through your entire AI infrastructure in seconds. Traditional security tools can't see or stop these AI-to-AI attacks because they were built for human-speed threats.

We built Strigoi with a unique Protocol Pipeline architecture - every security discovery flows through an immutable, auditable pipeline from research to implementation to testing, creating permanent documentation. This isn't just defense, it's building a living knowledge base of AI attack patterns. We monitor agent protocols in real-time, deploy multi-AI defensive coalitions, and every countermeasure becomes part of the permanent security record that the entire community can learn from.

## Even Shorter (30 seconds)

AI agents are the new attack surface - hackers use AI to compromise your AI at superhuman speed. We built the first security platform with an immutable Protocol Pipeline that captures every attack pattern into permanent, auditable documentation. Our multi-AI defense system doesn't just stop attacks - it documents them forever, building humanity's knowledge base for AI security. Every customer makes the entire ecosystem stronger through our shared protocol intelligence.
