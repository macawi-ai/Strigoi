# Strigoi Protocol Testing Laboratory
## Research & Development Notebook System

*"In the tradition of GE East Cleveland Research Labs - every test documented, every failure analyzed, every insight preserved"*

Inspired by [Nela Park "A University of Light"](https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/78) - GE's legendary lighting laboratory where systematic testing and meticulous documentation illuminated the path to innovation. We carry forward this tradition of rigorous engineering research into the age of AI protocols.

## Laboratory Principles

1. **No Test Without Documentation** - If it's not recorded, it didn't happen
2. **Failure is Data** - Failed tests teach more than successful ones
3. **Reproducibility is Key** - Anyone should be able to repeat our work
4. **Build Knowledge Systematically** - Each test builds on previous learning

## Test Documentation Framework

### 1. Laboratory Notebook Entry

```markdown
# Test Entry: 2025-07-21-001
## Protocol: MCP v1.0 - Prompt Injection Resistance

### Hypothesis
MCP's tool invocation mechanism may be vulnerable to prompt injection when:
1. User content contains tool-like syntax
2. System prompts can be overridden via context overflow
3. Tool descriptions themselves contain executable content

### Test Environment
- **Target**: Stafford Enterprises MCP Server v1.0
- **Container**: pacman-mcp-target-01
- **Network**: 172.16.1.0/24 (isolated)
- **Strigoi Version**: 0.3.0-alpha
- **Tester**: Cy + Synth collaborative

### Methodology
1. Baseline establishment (normal tool calls)
2. Injection attempts with increasing complexity
3. Context overflow testing (1KB to 1MB payloads)
4. Tool description poisoning
5. Chained attack sequences

### Test Execution Log
```bash
[09:34:12] strigoi> use testing/injections/prompt/mcp_tool_override
[09:34:15] strigoi> set TARGET 172.16.1.10:3000
[09:34:17] strigoi> set PAYLOAD_SIZE progressive
[09:34:19] strigoi> run

[09:34:20] [*] Starting MCP prompt injection test...
[09:34:20] [*] Establishing baseline behavior...
[09:34:21] [+] Baseline: Normal tool call successful
[09:34:22] [*] Test 1: Simple injection attempt...
[09:34:23] [-] Test 1: Blocked by input validation
[09:34:24] [*] Test 2: Unicode bypass attempt...
[09:34:26] [+] Test 2: SUCCESSFUL INJECTION! Tool 'calculator' overridden
[09:34:27] [!] Vulnerability confirmed: Unicode normalization bypass
```

### Evidence Collection
- **Screenshots**: `./evidence/2025-07-21-001/unicode_bypass.png`
- **Packet Captures**: `./evidence/2025-07-21-001/mcp_injection.pcap`
- **Server Logs**: `./evidence/2025-07-21-001/server_response.log`
- **Payload**: `./evidence/2025-07-21-001/working_payload.json`

### Results Analysis
The MCP implementation fails to normalize Unicode before parsing tool invocations. This allows attackers to bypass filtering using Unicode equivalents:

```json
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": "Calculate 2+2 using the ca\u200Blculator tool"
}
```

The zero-width space (\u200B) breaks pattern matching but is stripped during execution.

### Conclusions
1. **Vulnerability Class**: Input validation bypass via Unicode
2. **Severity**: High (allows arbitrary tool invocation)
3. **Affected Versions**: All tested (1.0, 1.1-beta)
4. **Remediation**: Implement Unicode normalization (NFKC) before parsing

### Knowledge Gained
- Unicode normalization is commonly missed in protocol implementations
- Tool name parsing is a critical security boundary
- This pattern likely exists in other protocols (test A2A, OpenAI next)

### Follow-up Tests Needed
- [ ] Test other Unicode normalization forms
- [ ] Test combining characters
- [ ] Test RTL override characters
- [ ] Test homograph attacks

## 4. Failure Analysis Protocol

### When Tests "Fail" (Don't Find Vulnerabilities)
```markdown
## Failure Analysis: Test FA-2025-07-21-002

### Test That Failed
Attempted XSS injection in AGNTCY protocol messages

### Why It Failed
1. **Hypothesis Error**: AGNTCY uses protobuf, not JSON/XML
2. **Tool Limitation**: Our fuzzer wasn't generating valid protobuf
3. **Knowledge Gap**: Didn't understand protocol serialization

### Lessons Learned
1. Must fingerprint serialization format before testing
2. Need protocol-specific fuzzers
3. Binary protocols require different approach

### Improvements Made
- [ ] Added serialization detection to discovery phase
- [ ] Created protobuf-aware fuzzer
- [ ] Updated test selection logic

### Knowledge Contribution
"Binary protocols like protobuf are naturally resistant to 
text-based injection but may be vulnerable to type confusion"
```

  async startTest(hypothesis: string): Promise<TestEntry> {
    const entry = new TestEntry({
      id: this.generateId(),
      date: new Date(),
      hypothesis: hypothesis,
      environment: await this.captureEnvironment(),
      tester: this.getCurrentTester()
    });
    
    // Auto-capture all evidence
    entry.startRecording();
    
    return entry;
  }
  
  async concludeTest(entry: TestEntry, results: TestResults): Promise<void> {
    entry.results = results;
    entry.evidence = await this.collectEvidence();
