# Stream Infrastructure Implementation - Phase 1, Day 1-2 Summary

## What We Accomplished

### Core Stream Infrastructure âœ…

1. **Stream Interfaces** (`internal/stream/interfaces.go`)
   - Defined core types: StreamType, Priority, StreamData
   - Created interfaces: StreamCapture, StreamHandler, Filter
   - Established processing pipeline stages (S1, S2, S3)
   - Defined metrics and result structures

2. **STDIO Stream Capture** (`internal/stream/stdio.go`)
   - Implemented local process I/O monitoring using PTY
   - Created subscription mechanism for handlers
   - Built ring buffer integration for efficient storage
   - Added filter chain support

3. **Ring Buffer Implementation** (`internal/stream/buffer.go`)
   - Thread-safe circular buffer for stream data
   - Smart buffer with dynamic sizing based on threat level
   - Context extraction for analysis windows
   - Efficient memory usage with overwrite on full

4. **S1 Edge Filters** (`internal/stream/filters.go`)
   - **RegexFilter**: Pre-compiled pattern matching
   - **KeywordFilter**: Fast string matching without regex
   - **RateLimitFilter**: Token bucket algorithm for flood prevention
   - **EntropyFilter**: Detects encrypted/compressed data
   - **LengthFilter**: Quick rejection of oversized payloads

5. **Attack Pattern Registry** (`internal/stream/patterns.go`)
   - Pre-compiled patterns for microsecond matching
   - Categories: SQL injection, command injection, path traversal, XSS, prompt injection
   - Severity levels and confidence scoring
   - Extensible pattern system

6. **Cybernetic Governors** (`internal/stream/governors.go`)
   - **AdaptiveGovernor**: Self-regulating filter health
   - **CircuitBreaker**: Prevents cascade failures
   - **ExponentialSmoothing**: Baseline tracking for anomaly detection
   - Implements VSM principles from Cyreal

7. **Stream Manager** (`internal/stream/manager.go`)
   - Manages multiple concurrent streams
   - Default filter creation
   - Helper functions for easy setup
   - Pattern registry integration

8. **Console Integration**
   - Added `stream` command to Strigoi console
   - Subcommands: setup, list, info, subscribe, stop, stats
   - Stream type support (stdio implemented, others planned)

## Architecture Highlights

### Hierarchical Processing
- **S1 (Edge)**: Microsecond filtering at capture
- **S2 (Shallow)**: Millisecond analysis (planned)
- **S3 (Deep)**: Second-level LLM analysis (planned)

### Cybernetic Principles
- Self-regulating components with health monitoring
- Adaptive behavior based on system conditions
- Learning from past performance
- Graceful degradation under stress

### Security First
- Command sanitization preventing sensitive data leakage
- Rate limiting to prevent DoS
- Pattern matching for known attacks
- Entropy detection for obfuscated payloads

## Testing & Validation

- Successfully builds with all dependencies
- Console commands integrated
- Stream manager initializes with framework
- Ready for live testing

## Next Steps (Phase 1, Week 1)

### Day 3-4: Hierarchical Processing Pipeline
- Implement S2 shallow analyzers
- Create S3 deep analysis interface
- Build pipeline orchestration
- Add stage metrics

### Day 5: Smart Buffer Management
- Implement threat-level based sizing
- Add historical data preservation
- Create efficient data routing
- Build performance monitoring

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Linux-only focus**: Simplified implementation, better performance
2. **Interface-based design**: Extensible for future stream types
3. **Pre-compiled patterns**: Microsecond performance for S1
4. **Cybernetic governance**: Self-regulating, adaptive behavior
5. **Modular filters**: Composable security checks

## Code Quality

- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Thread-safe implementations
- Performance-conscious design
- Following Go best practices
