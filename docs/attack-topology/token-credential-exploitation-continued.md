## Token Storage Vulnerabilities

### Common Storage Locations
- Configuration files in home directories
- Environment variables accessible to MCP process
- Browser local storage (for web-based MCP clients)
- Operating system credential stores
- Docker secrets and container environment

### Attack Amplification
1. **Token Scope Creep**: OAuth tokens often have broader permissions than needed
2. **Token Longevity**: Refresh tokens can provide indefinite access
3. **Cross-Service Impact**: One Gmail token might reveal calendar, drive, contacts
4. **No Revocation Awareness**: Victim unaware their token is compromised

## Vulnerability Chain

1. **Weak Storage Protection**: Credentials stored in readable locations
2. **Insufficient Access Controls**: Any user-level process can access
3. **No Token Binding**: Tokens work from any MCP server instance
4. **Limited Audit Trail**: Token usage not distinguished by source

## Detection Challenges

- Token usage appears legitimate to service providers
- MCP servers need credential access to function
- Hard to distinguish legitimate from malicious token use
- No built-in token rotation or monitoring

## Risk Factors

- **High Value Target**: Single token grants full service access
- **Easy Exploitation**: Simple file read yields working credentials  
- **Persistent Access**: Tokens often valid for months
- **Wide Attack Surface**: Multiple storage locations to target
