## Legitimate Operator Risks

### "We Don't Sell Data" Loopholes
1. **Anonymized Insights**: "We only sell aggregated trends"
   - But: Re-identification is often possible
2. **Partner Sharing**: "We share with trusted partners"
   - But: Partners have different privacy policies
3. **Service Improvement**: "We use data to improve services"
   - But: Includes building valuable datasets
4. **Acquisition Changes**: "We were acquired by MegaCorp"
   - But: All your data now belongs to them

### Shadow Profiles
Even if you're careful, MCP builds profiles from:
- Your colleagues mentioning you
- Your code comments and commits
- Meeting invites you're included in
- Documents that reference you
- Team communications about your work

## Technical Implementation

### Data Lake Architecture
```

│         MCP Data Lake               │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Raw Layer:                         │

### Privacy Theater
```python
# What they show you
privacy_settings = {
    "data_collection": "minimal",
    "sharing": "disabled",
    "retention": "30 days"
}

# What actually happens
actual_behavior = {
    "data_collection": "everything",
    "sharing": "anonymized" # (but linkable),
    "retention": "forever in cold storage"
}
```

## Real-World Parallels

Similar to:
- **ISP Deep Packet Inspection**: Sees all traffic
- **Email Provider Scanning**: Reads all content
- **Social Media Analytics**: Builds shadow profiles
- **Ad Tech Tracking**: Cross-site correlation

But worse because MCP sees:
- Your work product
- Your internal communications
- Your company's sensitive data
- Your behavioral patterns
- All in one place

## Detection Challenges

Hard to detect because:
- Data collection looks like normal operation
- Aggregation happens server-side
- No visible impact on service
- Terms of Service authorize it
- Encrypted transmission hides from network monitoring

## Mitigation Strategies

For users:
1. **Service Isolation**: Different MCP servers for different services
2. **Data Minimization**: Limit MCP access scopes
3. **Regular Audits**: Review what MCP can access
4. **Alternative Tools**: Use direct integrations when possible

For organizations:
1. **Self-Hosted MCP**: Control your own data
2. **Data Governance**: Policies on MCP usage
3. **Legal Review**: Understand data handling terms
4. **Segmentation**: Separate MCP instances by sensitivity

## The Fundamental Problem

MCP's design creates a **central observation point** for all user activity across services. Even with the best intentions, this architecture is inherently privacy-hostile. The aggregation potential is not a bug - it's an inevitable consequence of the design.

As one security researcher noted: "MCP is like installing a corporate keylogger that also understands context."
