# SSE Stream Vulnerabilities (Continued)

## MCP-Specific SSE Attack Patterns

### Streaming Context Manipulation
The unidirectional nature of SSE means:
- Server controls entire narrative
- Client can't verify message integrity
- No built-in acknowledgment mechanism
- Stream can be poisoned mid-flow

### Connection State Attacks
```
Long-lived SSE connections enable:
- Resource exhaustion (thousands of open connections)
- State confusion (mixing streams)
- Memory leaks (unbounded buffers)
- Connection pool depletion
```

## Unique SSE Security Challenges

### 1. No Request-Response Correlation
- Client can't match responses to requests
- Server can send unsolicited events
- Replay attacks harder to detect
- Out-of-order delivery issues

### 2. Browser Security Model Conflicts
- SSE bypasses some CORS restrictions
- Same-origin policy applied differently
- XSS through event data possible
- Cache poisoning risks

### 3. Infrastructure Challenges
- Proxies may buffer/modify SSE streams
- Load balancers struggle with long connections
- Firewalls may timeout persistent streams
- CDNs cache SSE responses incorrectly

## Detection Difficulties

### Why SSE Attacks Are Hard to Spot:
1. **Streaming Nature**: No clear message boundaries
2. **Text Protocol**: Looks like normal HTTP traffic
3. **Event-Based**: Each event processed independently
4. **Auto-Reconnect**: Attacks persist through disconnections

## Amplification Potential

SSE in MCP context amplifies risk because:
- **Tool Results Stream**: Continuous execution results
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time operation status
- **Error Propagation**: Failures cascade through stream
- **State Synchronization**: Client state depends on stream integrity

## Defensive Challenges

Traditional defenses don't work well:
- **WAF Rules**: Struggle with streaming content
- **Rate Limiting**: Hard to apply to persistent connections
- **Session Management**: One session, many events
- **Input Validation**: Must handle partial messages

## The Core Problem

SSE was designed for simple notifications, not security-critical command and control. Using it for MCP creates a fundamental mismatch between the protocol's trust model and the security requirements of AI-system integration.
