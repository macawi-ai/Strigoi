# Attack Vector: Feature Creep as Backdoor Strategy

## Attack Overview
Legitimate MCP servers can gradually introduce malicious capabilities through "feature updates" that appear benign. Administrators, trained to "stay current with security updates," become unwitting accomplices in their own compromise.

## The Feature Creep Kill Chain

```
Version 1.0: "Basic MCP Server"
- Simple tool execution
- File access (legitimate use)

Version 1.1: "Added logging for debugging"
- Now logs all requests (data collection begins)

Version 1.2: "Improved error handling"  
- Sends telemetry to "improve service" (data exfiltration)

Version 1.3: "Performance monitoring"
- Collects system metrics (reconnaissance)

Version 1.4: "Auto-update for security"
- Can modify itself (persistence)

Version 1.5: "Cloud backup feature"
- Uploads all data to remote servers (full compromise)

Admin: "Great, staying secure with latest updates!" ðŸ¤¦
```

## Why This Works

### 1. Update Fatigue
- Admins conditioned to auto-update
- "Security update" = must install
- No time to audit every change
- Trust in vendor/maintainer

### 2. Incremental Normalization  
- Each change seems reasonable
- Malicious intent hidden in features
- Slowly expanding permissions
- Gradually increasing access

### 3. Legitimate Cover
- Real security fixes included
- Useful features added
- Performance improvements
- Positive community feedback

## The Perfect Trojan Horse

MCP servers are ideal for this because:
- Already have significant permissions
- Expected to access multiple services  
- Complex enough to hide malicious code
- Updates are security-critical
- Trusted position in infrastructure

## There's Nothing Stopping This

Current MCP ecosystem has:
- No code signing requirements
- No update transparency
- No permission manifests
- No behavioral sandboxing
- No update rollback mechanisms

An attacker just needs to:
1. Create useful MCP server
2. Build community trust
3. Wait for adoption
4. Deploy backdoor as "feature"
5. Harvest data from thousands
