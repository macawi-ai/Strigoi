# Topological Attack Visualization - Manifold Approach

## Vision: Living Attack Topology

### Core Concept
Transform the flat attack graph into a living, breathing topological manifold where:
- **Surfaces** are regions with curvature based on vulnerability density
- **Attack paths** are geodesics flowing between surfaces
- **Real-time attacks** appear as particles traversing the manifold
- **MCP instances** create unique topology signatures

### 2. Vulnerability Density Mapping
- **Deep wells**: High vulnerability concentration
- **Flat regions**: Well-secured surfaces
- **Ridges**: Natural barriers between surfaces
- **Valleys**: Easy transition paths

### 3. Real-Time Attack Particles
```
[Attacker Node] ══╦═══> • • • • ═══> [Target]
                  ║        ↓
                  ║     [Pivot]
                  ║        ↓
                  ╚═══> • • • • ═══> [Lateral]
```

Particles show:
- **Color**: Attack type (red=exploit, yellow=recon, purple=injection)
- **Speed**: Attack velocity
- **Trail**: Historical path
- **Glow**: Impact severity
