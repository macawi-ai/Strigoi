# Stream Infrastructure Implementation Phases

## Overview
Progressive implementation of Strigoi's real-time multi-LLM defense system, starting with local STDIO and expanding to full stream coverage over 6 months.

## Phase 1: Local STDIO Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### Core Capabilities
- Local process I/O monitoring (stdin/stdout/stderr)
- Command execution tracking
- Process hierarchy monitoring
- Basic stream API for modules

### Strategic Patterns Applied
- **Hierarchical Processing**: S1 (filtering) → S2 (shallow) → S3 (deep analysis)
- **Multi-LLM Pipeline**: Claude (primary) + Gemini (via A2A)
- **Edge Filtering**: Pattern matching before LLM submission
- **Smart Buffering**: Context-aware stream windowing
- **Basic Consensus**: Simple voting mechanism

### Implementation Week 1
- Stream capture infrastructure
- Process monitoring hooks
- Buffer management system
- Basic filtering rules

### Implementation Week 2
- LLM integration (mock first, then real)
- Consensus engine basics
- Module subscription API
- Initial attack detection patterns

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for stream capture
- Integration tests with mock LLMs
- Simulated attack scenarios
- Performance benchmarks

### Success Metrics
- < 10ms capture latency
- 95% malicious command detection
- < 1% false positive rate
- Handles 1000 commands/second

## Phase 2: Remote STDIO via A2A (Month 2)

### Core Capabilities
- Deploy Cyreal A2A agents remotely
- Secure agent communication
- Cross-platform STDIO capture (Linux primary, Windows secondary)
- Multi-host correlation

### Strategic Patterns
- **Agent Management**: Automated deployment and health monitoring
- **Secure Channels**: RFC-1918 enforcement, token auth
- **Stream Aggregation**: Correlate across multiple hosts
- **Distributed Analysis**: LLMs analyze streams from multiple sources

### Dependencies
- Cyreal A2A infrastructure
- Agent deployment automation
- Secure key management

### Success Metrics
- < 50ms remote capture latency
- Support 100 simultaneous agents
- 99.9% agent uptime
- Zero unauthorized agent deployments

## Phase 3: Serial/USB Monitoring (Month 3)

### Core Capabilities
- RS-232/485 monitoring
- USB device communication capture
- Industrial protocol detection (Modbus, CAN)
- IoT device security

### Strategic Patterns
- **Protocol Awareness**: Understand industrial protocols
- **Anomaly Detection**: Baseline normal device behavior
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Special handling for SCADA/ICS

### Use Cases
- Industrial control system monitoring
- IoT device security
- Hardware implant detection
- Supply chain security

### Success Metrics
- Support major industrial protocols
- < 1ms serial capture latency
- Detect 95% of protocol violations
- Zero impact on industrial processes

## Phase 4: Network Stream Integration (Months 4-5)

### Core Capabilities
- TCP/UDP stream monitoring
- Application protocol analysis
- API traffic inspection
- WebSocket real-time streams

### Strategic Patterns
- **Deep Packet Inspection**: With privacy preservation
- **Protocol State Machines**: Track connection states
- **Encrypted Traffic**: Metadata analysis without decryption
- **API Behavior**: Learn normal vs anomalous API usage

### Advanced Features
- TLS fingerprinting
- Behavioral analysis
- Zero-trust verification
- Lateral movement detection

### Success Metrics
- 10Gbps line-rate processing
- Support 50+ protocols
- < 100ms detection latency
- Maintain user privacy

## Phase 5: Advanced AI Features (Month 6+)

### Predictive Defense
- Attack precursor detection
- Behavioral prophecy
- Threat actor profiling

### Adaptive Systems
- Dynamic honeypot generation
- Immune system memory cells
- Antibody pattern generation

### Collective Intelligence
- Federated learning
- Anonymous telemetry sharing
- Cross-infrastructure correlation

### Next-Generation Features
- Quantum-resistant protocols
- Homomorphic analysis
- Differential privacy
- Adversarial AI defense
