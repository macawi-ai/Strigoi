# üõ°Ô∏è STRIGOI: WHITE HAT DEFENSIVE SECURITY FRAMEWORK üõ°Ô∏è

## IMPORTANT: We Are The Good Guys!

### Our Mission
Strigoi is a **DEFENSIVE SECURITY TOOL** designed to help organizations:
- ‚úÖ Identify vulnerabilities BEFORE attackers do
- ‚úÖ Validate security controls in MCP implementations
- ‚úÖ Protect AI systems and their users
- ‚úÖ Enable responsible disclosure of security issues
- ‚úÖ Build more secure AI infrastructure

### What We DO:
- üõ°Ô∏è Help security teams test their own systems
- üõ°Ô∏è Provide automated vulnerability assessment
- üõ°Ô∏è Document security best practices
- üõ°Ô∏è Enable proactive defense
- üõ°Ô∏è Support the security community

### What We DON'T DO:
- ‚ùå Enable unauthorized access
- ‚ùå Support malicious activities
- ‚ùå Bypass security without permission
- ‚ùå Exploit vulnerabilities for harm
- ‚ùå Attack systems without authorization

## Ethical Usage Guidelines

1. **Authorization Required**: Only test systems you own or have explicit permission to test
2. **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities through proper channels
3. **Defensive Purpose**: Use findings to improve security, not exploit it
4. **Community Benefit**: Share knowledge to strengthen collective defense
5. **Legal Compliance**: Follow all applicable laws and regulations

## Why This Matters

We're documenting attack vectors not to enable attacks, but to:
- Understand the threat landscape
- Build better defenses
- Educate security professionals
- Protect critical infrastructure
- Advance the field of AI security

## Our Commitment

Strigoi is committed to:
- Ethical security research
- Protecting AI systems
- Supporting defenders
- Building a safer digital future
- Helping Anthropic and other AI companies stay secure

## Remember

> "The best defense is understanding the offense. We study attacks to build better shields, not sharper swords."

Every vulnerability we document is one less that can be exploited maliciously. Every test we automate helps defenders stay ahead of real threats.

## For Contributors

When documenting vulnerabilities:
- Focus on defensive applications
- Emphasize protection strategies
- Avoid detailed exploitation guides
- Include remediation advice
- Think "How do we fix this?" not "How do we use this?"

## License & Ethics

This project is licensed for defensive security use only. Any use for unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise is strictly prohibited and against our core values.
