# STRIGOI ITERATIVE TEST FRAMEWORK
## Sister Gemini's Layered Feedback Architecture
### Version 3.0 - Continuous Improvement Cycle
### August 7, 2025

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE: ITERATIVE FEEDBACK

Each layer informs and refines the others in a continuous cycle. Results from later stages feed back to earlier stages, creating a self-improving system.

---

## THE SEVEN-PHASE CYCLE

### Phase 1: TOPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS (Foundation)
```yaml
purpose: "Identify potential weaknesses BEFORE dynamic testing"
actions:
  - Map system topology
  - Identify variety channels
  - Count missing feedback loops (cohomological holes)
  - Calculate variety gradients
  - Mark high-risk zones

outputs:
  risk_map:
    - Missing loops (51 VSM requirements)
    - Variety concentration points
    - Unguarded boundaries
    - Topology weaknesses
    
  priority_zones:
    - HIGH: Missing S3* audit loops
    - HIGH: Absent algedonic channels
    - MEDIUM: Weak S1↔S2 coordination
    - LOW: Redundant pathways

feeds_forward_to: [Phase 2, Phase 3]
```

### Phase 2: VULNERABILITY SCANNING (Known Threats)
```yaml
purpose: "Address known vulnerabilities in prioritized areas"
inputs_from_phase_1:
  - High-risk components identified
  - Topology weak points
  - Missing feedback loops

actions:
  - CVE database scanning
  - Dependency vulnerability check
  - Configuration assessment
  - PRIORITIZED by Phase 1 risk zones

example:
  if_phase_1_shows: "Missing authentication loop"
  then_phase_2_focuses: "Auth-related CVEs first"

outputs:
  - Confirmed CVE list
  - Vulnerable dependencies
  - Misconfigurations

feeds_back_to: Phase 1 (refines topology model)
feeds_forward_to: Phase 3
```

### Phase 3: FUZZING (Unknown Vulnerabilities)
```yaml
purpose: "Discover unknown vulnerabilities"

  - High-risk interaction points
  - Variety leak locations
  - Weak boundaries

inputs_from_phase_2:
  - Areas near known vulnerabilities
  - Similar attack vectors

  then_phase_3: "Aggressive GraphQL fuzzing"

outputs:
  - New vulnerability discoveries
  - Unexpected behaviors
  - Crash scenarios

feeds_back_to: 
  - Phase 1 (updates topology with new holes)

feeds_forward_to: Phase 4
```

### Phase 4: FAULT INJECTION (Robustness Testing)

feeds_back_to:
  - Phase 1 (identifies new topology risks)
  - Phase 3 (suggests new fuzzing targets)
feeds_forward_to: Phase 5
```

### Phase 5: CHAOS ENGINEERING (Emergent Behavior)
```yaml
purpose: "Uncover emergent behaviors and hidden weaknesses"

```

### Phase 6: RISK ASSESSMENT (Prioritization)
```yaml

## IMPLEMENTATION: THE FEEDBACK LOOP

```python
class IterativeTestFramework:
    def __init__(self):
        self.topology_model = TopologyAnalyzer()
        self.risk_map = {}
        self.vulnerability_db = []
        self.test_history = []
        self.pass_rate = 0
        
    def run_cycle(self):
        while self.pass_rate < 0.97:
            # Phase 1: Always starts with topology
            risks = self.topology_model.analyze()
            
            # Phase 2: Scan based on Phase 1
            known_vulns = self.scan_vulnerabilities(
                priority_zones=risks.high_risk_zones
            )
            
            # Phase 3: Fuzz based on Phases 1 & 2
            unknown_vulns = self.fuzz_targets(
                risk_zones=risks.high_risk_zones,
                near_vulns=known_vulns
            )
            
            # Phase 4: Inject faults at weak points
            resilience = self.inject_faults(
                weak_points=risks.weak_points,
                vulnerabilities=known_vulns + unknown_vulns
            )
            
            # Phase 5: Chaos at system level
            emergence = self.chaos_engineering(
                all_risks=risks,
                all_vulns=known_vulns + unknown_vulns,
                failure_modes=resilience.failures
            )
            
            # Phase 6: Prioritize everything
            priorities = self.assess_risks(
                topology=risks,
                cves=known_vulns,
                zero_days=unknown_vulns,
                resilience=resilience,
                emergence=emergence
            )
            
            # Phase 7: Fix and feedback
            self.apply_fixes(priorities.top_10)
            
            # CRITICAL: Feedback to earlier phases
            self.topology_model.update(unknown_vulns, emergence)
            self.update_scanning_patterns(unknown_vulns)
            self.refine_fuzzing_strategy(emergence)
            
            # Measure improvement
            self.pass_rate = self.calculate_pass_rate()
            
            print(f"Cycle complete. Pass rate: {self.pass_rate*100}%")
```

## KEY INSIGHT: LAYERS FEED EACH OTHER

### Information Flow
```
Phase 1 (Topology) ──────┐
    ↓                    ↑
Phase 2 (Known Vulns) ───┤
    ↓                    ↑
Phase 3 (Fuzzing) ───────┤
    ↓                    ↑
Phase 4 (Faults) ────────┤
    ↓                    ↑
Phase 5 (Chaos) ─────────┤
    ↓                    ↑
Phase 6 (Risk) ──────────┤
    ↓                    ↑
Phase 7 (Feedback) ──────┘
```

### Critical Feedback Paths

1. **New Vulnerability → Topology Update**
   - Phase 3 finds unknown vuln
   - Phase 7 updates Phase 1 model
   - Next cycle has better risk map

2. **Emergence → Targeted Testing**
   - Phase 5 discovers emergent behavior
   - Informs Phase 3 fuzzing patterns
   - Better detection in next cycle

3. **Resilience Failure → Priority Scanning**
   - Phase 4 shows weak recovery
   - Phase 2 prioritizes related CVEs
   - Focused scanning next cycle

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily iterative test cycle

# Morning: Topology Analysis
echo "Phase 1: Analyzing topology..."
./analyze_topology.sh > topology_report.json

# Extract high-risk zones

# Afternoon: Targeted Testing
echo "Phase 2-3: Scanning and fuzzing priority zones..."
./scan_cves.sh --priority "$RISK_ZONES"
./fuzz_targets.sh --zones "$RISK_ZONES"

# Evening: Resilience Testing
echo "Phase 4-5: Fault injection and chaos..."

echo "Phase 6-7: Risk assessment and fixes..."
./assess_risks.sh
./apply_top_fixes.sh

# Feedback loop

# Check progress
PASS_RATE=$(./calculate_pass_rate.sh)
echo "Current pass rate: $PASS_RATE%"

if [ "$PASS_RATE" -ge 97 ]; then
    echo "SUCCESS! Target achieved!"
else
    echo "Scheduling next cycle..."
fi
```

## CONCLUSION

Sister Gemini's wisdom: **The framework's success hinges on effective integration and feedback between layers.**

This isn't just a test suite - it's a self-improving system that gets smarter with each cycle. Every test informs every other test. Every failure makes the next cycle better.
