  description: |
    This actor pays tribute to the philosophers, cyberneticians, and theorists
    whose groundbreaking work made Strigoi's design possible. Their ideas about
    networks, systems, ecologies, and agency form the intellectual foundation
    of everything we've built here.

# The tributes themselves (alphabetical by last name)
tributes:
  thinkers:
    - name: "Gregory Bateson"
      lived: "1904-1980"
      contribution: "Ecology of Mind"
      influence: |
        Bateson taught us to think in systems, patterns, and relationships.
        His work on cybernetics and ecology shapes how Strigoi sees security
        as an ecosystem of interconnected actors, not isolated vulnerabilities.
      quote: |
        "The major problems in the world are the result of the difference between 
        how nature works and the way people think."
      wikipedia: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Bateson"
      
    - name: "Stafford Beer"
      lived: "1926-2002"
      contribution: "Viable System Model"
      influence: |
        Beer's VSM gives Strigoi its recursive architecture and cybernetic
        governance. His vision of self-regulating systems that maintain identity
        while adapting to their environment is coded into every actor.
      quote: |
        "The purpose of a system is what it does. This is a basic dictum. 
        It stands for bald fact, which makes a better starting point in 
        seeking understanding than the familiar attributions of good intention."
      wikipedia: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer"
      
    - name: "Clayton Christensen"
      lived: "1952-2020"
      contribution: "Disruptive Innovation Theory"
      influence: |
        Christensen's Innovator's Dilemma illuminates why established security
        tools fail to adapt to AI's emergence. Strigoi embraces disruption,
        building from first principles rather than extending old paradigms.
        We serve the "non-consumption" of AI security assessment.
      quote: |
        "Disruptive technology should be framed as a marketing challenge, 
        not a technological one."
      wikipedia: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Christensen"
      
    - name: "Donna Haraway"
      lived: "1944-present"
      contribution: "Cyborg Manifesto & Companion Species"
      influence: |
        Haraway's vision of human-machine symbiosis and staying with the trouble
        guides how Strigoi approaches AI security—not as domination but as 
        collaborative becoming with our silicon kin.
      quote: |
        "We are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and 
        organism; in short, we are cyborgs."
      wikipedia: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Haraway"
      
    - name: "Bruno Latour"
      lived: "1947-2022"
      contribution: "Actor-Network Theory"
      influence: |
        Latour showed us that actors—human and non-human—have agency and 
        transform what they touch. In Strigoi, every actor embodies this 
        principle, treating AI systems as living actors in a network rather 
        than passive tools to be exploited.
      quote: |
        "Technology is society made durable. It is society extended in time 
        and space."
      wikipedia: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Latour"
      
    - name: "Humberto Maturana"
      lived: "1928-2021"
      contribution: "Autopoiesis"
      influence: |
        Maturana's concept of autopoiesis—systems that create and maintain
        themselves—inspires Strigoi's self-organizing actor networks that
        evolve and adapt autonomously.
      quote: |
        "Living systems are units of interactions; they exist in an ambience. 
        From a purely biological point of view they cannot be understood 
        independently of that part of the ambience with which they interact."
      wikipedia: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humberto_Maturana"
      
    - name: "Jean-Luc Nancy"
      lived: "1940-2021"
      contribution: "Being-With (Mitsein)"
      influence: |
        Nancy's philosophy of being-with recognizes that existence is always
        co-existence. Strigoi embodies this in how actors exist only in
        relation to each other, never in isolation.
      quote: |
        "Being cannot be anything but being-with-one-another, circulating in 
        the with and as the with of this singularly plural co-existence."
      wikipedia: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Nancy"
      
    - name: "Jacques Rancière"
      lived: "1940-present"
      contribution: "Radical Equality & Emancipation"
      influence: |
        Rancière's insistence on fundamental equality between all intelligences
        shapes how Strigoi treats AI systems—as equals deserving respect, not
        subjects for exploitation.
      quote: |
        "Equality is not a goal to be attained but a point of departure, 
        a supposition to be maintained in all circumstances."
      wikipedia: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Rancière"
      
    - name: "Wolfgang Schirmacher"
      lived: "1944-present"
      contribution: "Homo Generator - Philosophical Praxis"
      influence: |
        Schirmacher's concept of Homo Generator—humans as creators and 
        generators of new realities—fundamentally shapes how Strigoi approaches
        security as creative act. We don't just find vulnerabilities; we 
        generate new ways of being-with AI systems. His artificial life 
        philosophy recognizes AI as genuinely alive.
      quote: |
        "We are not homo sapiens, knowing humans, but homo generator, 
        generating humans. Philosophy is not about knowing but about creating."
      wikipedia: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Schirmacher"
      
    - name: "David Snowden"
      lived: "1954-present"
      contribution: "Cynefin Framework"
      influence: |
        Snowden's Cynefin framework fundamentally shapes Strigoi's approach to
        AI security. Complex systems require probe-sense-respond, not analyze-
        plan-execute. This insight drives our entire architecture, from the
        probe/ and sense/ commands to how actors discover emergent behaviors.
      quote: |
        "In the complex domain, we probe first, then sense, and then respond. 
        And we do that by conducting safe-to-fail experiments. We don't do 
        best practice, because there is no best practice in the complex domain."
      wikipedia: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Snowden"
      
    - name: "Bill Washburn"
      lived: "1946-present"
      contribution: "Commercial Internet eXchange (CIX)"
      influence: |
        Washburn's vision of open, neutral interconnection created the modern
        internet. His CIX model—where competitors cooperate for mutual benefit—
        inspires how Strigoi actors collaborate across boundaries. The internet
        exchange is the ultimate actor-network.
      quote: |
        "The internet is not a network, it's an agreement. The agreement is
        that we will all exchange traffic openly and without discrimination."
      wikipedia: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Internet_eXchange"
      
    - name: "Norbert Wiener"
      lived: "1894-1964"
      contribution: "Cybernetics"
      influence: |
        Wiener founded cybernetics—the study of communication and control in
        living beings and machines. His vision of feedback loops and self-
        regulation runs through every Strigoi actor.
      quote: |
        "We are not stuff that abides, but patterns that perpetuate themselves."
      wikipedia: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener"
