# Strigoi v0.4.0-beta Release Notes

## Release Date: 2025-08-05

## Overview
This beta release marks the completion of Phase 3 development, introducing advanced ML-based threat detection, distributed processing capabilities, and comprehensive telemetry systems. The platform is now ready for user testing with full security monitoring capabilities.

## Major Features

### 1. Machine Learning Threat Detection
- **Pattern Detection Engine**: ML-based pattern recognition for security threats
- **Feature Extraction**: Advanced feature engineering from security events
- **Model Support**: 
  - Random Forest classifier for supervised learning
  - Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
  - Hybrid mode combining both approaches
- **LLM Acceleration**: Optional integration with OpenAI/Anthropic for enhanced analysis

### 2. Distributed Processing Framework
- **Coordinator/Worker Architecture**: Scalable distributed event processing
- **Load Balancing Strategies**:
  - Least-loaded node selection
  - Weighted response time balancing
  - Power-of-two choices
  - Adaptive strategy switching
- **Partitioning Support**:
  - Hash-based partitioning
  - Consistent hashing with virtual nodes
  - Round-robin distribution
  - Weighted partitioning
  - Key affinity routing
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic failover and task retry mechanisms

### 3. Comprehensive Telemetry System
- **Multi-Collector Architecture**:
  - Performance metrics (CPU, memory, latency)
  - Security event metrics
  - System resource monitoring
  - Custom metric support
- **Export Formats**:
  - Prometheus metrics endpoint
  - JSON API for dashboards
  - Real-time alerting system
- **Alert Management**:
  - Configurable thresholds
  - Multi-severity alerts
  - Rate limiting and deduplication
  - Webhook integration

### 4. SIEM Integration
- **ELK Stack Support**: Native Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana integration
- **Splunk Integration**: Full Splunk forwarder compatibility
- **Event Conversion**: Automatic format translation for SIEM systems
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient bulk event transmission

### 5. Security Audit Framework
- **Code Security Scanner**: Static analysis for vulnerabilities
- **Configuration Auditor**: Security misconfiguration detection
- **Runtime Security Checks**: Dynamic security assessment
- **Compliance Validation**: Security best practices enforcement

## Technical Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- Lock-free circular buffer implementation
- Sub-millisecond event processing latency
- Efficient memory management with buffer pools
- Optimized feature extraction pipeline

### Code Quality
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Go fmt/vet compliance
- Build tags for demo isolation
- Proper error handling throughout

## Breaking Changes
- ML configuration now requires explicit model type selection
- Distributed mode requires coordinator configuration
- Telemetry system needs explicit collector registration

## Known Issues
- Mock implementations for capture/dissect engines (pending full implementation)
- Some golangci-lint style warnings (non-critical)

## Installation & Usage
```bash
# Build the binary
go build -o strigoi cmd/strigoi/main.go

# Run with default configuration
./strigoi probe

# Enable ML detection
./strigoi probe --ml-enabled --ml-model hybrid

# Start distributed coordinator
./strigoi probe --distributed --coordinator

# Enable telemetry
./strigoi probe --telemetry --prometheus-port 9090
```

## Testing Guidelines
1. Test ML detection accuracy with various threat scenarios
2. Verify distributed processing under load
3. Monitor telemetry metrics for performance
4. Validate SIEM integration with your systems
5. Run security audit on test deployments

## Next Steps
- Phase 4: Production hardening and performance optimization
- Enhanced ML model training capabilities
- Additional SIEM platform support
- Advanced visualization dashboards
