echo "=== Business Impact Analysis ==="
echo
echo "IMMEDIATE IMPACTS:"
echo "- Data breach notification required (72 hours)"
echo "- Customer data compromised (100% exposure)"
echo "- Intellectual property theft (source code)"
echo "- Regulatory fines (GDPR: 4% revenue)"
echo "- Incident response costs (~$4.2M average)"
echo

echo "LONG-TERM IMPACTS:"
echo "- Reputation damage (customer trust)"
echo "- Competitive disadvantage (IP theft)"
echo "- Supply chain compromise (backdoored code)"
echo "- Legal liability (shareholder lawsuits)"
echo "- Compliance remediation (12-18 months)"
echo

echo "=== Attack Timeline ==="

echo "=== Key Risk Indicators ==="
echo
echo "Attack Complexity:        ⭐ (Trivial)"
echo "Required Access:          Same user (no escalation)"
echo "Detection Probability:    <10% (appears legitimate)"
echo "Automation Potential:     100% (fully scriptable)"
echo "Defender Response Time:   Hours to days"
echo "Attacker Dwell Time:      Potentially months"
echo

echo "=== Executive Summary ==="
echo
echo "The MCP same-user security model represents an UNACCEPTABLE risk:"
echo
echo "1. ANY compromise of user account = TOTAL infrastructure compromise"
echo "2. NO security boundaries between critical systems"
echo "3. NO detection capabilities (looks like normal user activity)"
echo "4. NO effective mitigations within current architecture"
echo "5. NO compliance with security standards (SOC2, ISO 27001)"
echo
echo "RECOMMENDATION: Immediate prohibition of MCP in production environments"
echo "                 until fundamental architectural changes are implemented."
